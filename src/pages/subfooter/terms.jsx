              We may share such personal information with the third parties
              listed in the above section entitled, How we share your personal
              information. California law requires that we provide you with
              additional information about certain disclosures to such third
              parties within the past 12 months, particularly, where the
              disclosure involves monetary or other consideration. California
              treats these disclosures as sales of information, even where no
              money is exchanged. We do not sell data.
